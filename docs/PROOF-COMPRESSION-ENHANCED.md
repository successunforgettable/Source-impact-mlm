- **Total Commissions Paid:** â‚¹800.00
- **Commission Rate:** 40.0%

## Compression Rules Verified

âœ… **Compression Logic:** Both M20 and M19 purchases compressed to John (only qualified member)
âœ… **IT Preservation:** Immediate sponsors (M19, M18) received 10% IT despite not being qualified
âœ… **Position Integrity:** M20 positioned under M19, M19 under M18 (permanent_sponsor_id preserved)
âœ… **No Retroactive Pay:** M19 becoming qualified doesn't trigger back-payments for M20's sale
âœ… **Financial Accuracy:** All commission calculations correct (30% pass-up, 10% IT)

## Key Insights

1. **Compression Behavior:** When unqualified members exist in the upline chain, pass-up commissions automatically compress to the nearest qualified member while preserving the sponsorship structure.

2. **IT Commission Protection:** Immediate sponsors always receive their 10% IT commission regardless of their qualification status, ensuring introducers are rewarded.

3. **Position Permanence:** Member positions in each phase remain fixed at enrollment time and are not affected by later qualification changes.

4. **No Retroactive Adjustments:** The system maintains financial integrity by not creating retroactive payments when members later qualify.
