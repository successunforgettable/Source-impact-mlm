Generated: 2025-08-14T21:33:09Z UTC

## Test Overview
This proof demonstrates that all legacy compensation systems have been disabled via feature flags,
while preserving the new Challenge Store + 2-Up integration as the primary compensation system.

## Feature Flag Configuration
```json
"Features": {
  "Binary": false,
  "MatchUp": false,
  "Affiliate": false,
  "DirectMonthly": false,
  "TraditionalShop": false
}
```

## Backend Gating Summary
| Legacy System | Methods Gated | Status |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Binary Compensation | 6 methods | âœ… DISABLED |
| MatchUp Team Bonuses | 6 methods | âœ… DISABLED |
| Affiliate Commissions | 6 methods | âœ… DISABLED |
| Direct Monthly Bonuses | 7 methods | âœ… DISABLED |

### Gated Backend Methods
- `run_daily()`: Skips disabled compensation checks
- `run_cron()`: Skips disabled compensation pipelines
- `run_to_yesterday()`: Skips disabled status checks
- `week1_binary(), weekly_binary()`: Binary compensation (disabled)
- `week1_match(), weekly_match()`: MatchUp compensation (disabled)
- `week1_affiliate(), weekly_affiliate()`: Affiliate compensation (disabled)
- `week4_direct(), monthly_direct()`: Direct monthly bonuses (disabled)

## UI Transformation Summary

|--------|-------------|--------|
| Challenge Store | 5 menu items | âœ… ACTIVE |
