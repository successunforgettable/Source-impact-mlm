## Backfill Statistics

### Points Ledger Overview

```sql
SELECT 
    source_code,
    currency,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(points) as total_points,
    AVG(points) as avg_points
FROM points_ledger 
GROUP BY source_code, currency 
ORDER BY source_code, currency;
```

IT	USD	14	360.00	25.714286
PASSUP	USD	35	1856.54	53.044000
KEEPER	USD	6	680.00	113.333333

### Sample Points Ledger Records

```sql
SELECT 
    memberid,
    phase,
    source_code,
    points,
    currency,
    LEFT(note, 30) as note_preview,
    created_at
FROM points_ledger 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Wallet Balances

### Top 10 Member Balances by Currency

```sql
SELECT 
    memberid,
    currency,
    balance,
    transaction_count,
    last_transaction
FROM wallet_balance 
ORDER BY currency, balance DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

1	USD	1438.04	26	2025-08-16 15:31:26
200	USD	580.00	7	2025-08-15 02:46:55

### Currency Distribution

```sql
SELECT 
    currency,
    COUNT(*) as member_count,
    SUM(balance) as total_balance,
    AVG(balance) as avg_balance,
    MAX(balance) as max_balance
FROM wallet_balance 
GROUP BY currency;
```

USD	10	2896.54	289.654000	1438.04

## Data Integrity Verification

### Commission vs Points Comparison

```sql
SELECT 
    'Commissions' as source,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM commissions
WHERE amount > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Points (Backfilled)' as source,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(points) as total_amount
FROM points_ledger
WHERE note LIKE 'backfill:commission:%';
```

Commissions	55	2896.54
Points (Backfilled)	55	2896.54

### Points by Phase Distribution

```sql
SELECT 
    phase,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(points) as total_points,
    COUNT(DISTINCT memberid) as unique_members
FROM points_ledger 
WHERE phase IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY phase 
ORDER BY phase;
```

1	27	507.90	6
2	18	1368.64	6
30	1	400.00	1
