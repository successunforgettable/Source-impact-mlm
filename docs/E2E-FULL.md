### âœ… Unified System Assertions Passed
- **Challenge Integration**: Challenge unlocks + completion recorded for Harry (P0â†’P1 completed, P2 unlocked/purchased)
- **2-Up Logic**: First two = 10% IT (recruiter) + 30% PASSUP (Company); third+ = 40% KEEPER (no pass-up)
- **Per-Phase Reset**: Phase 2 behaves like fresh first-two (verified X1â†’PASSUP_1, X2â†’PASSUP_2, X3â†’KEEPER)
- **SoR Preservation**: Repeat uses Sponsor-of-Record (same recruiter gets commissions, same Company gets PASSUP)
- **Multi-Level**: Downline pass-ups work correctly (A1,A2,B1,B2 commissions proper)
- **Sales Annotation**: All sales properly tagged with challenge_phase and repeat_flag
- **Commission Integrity**: All percentages calculated correctly (10%/30%/40%)
