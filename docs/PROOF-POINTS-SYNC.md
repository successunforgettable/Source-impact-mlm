FROM commissions c
LEFT JOIN points_ledger p ON (
    p.memberid = c.receiver_user_id 
    AND p.saleid = c.order_id 
    AND p.source_code IN ('IT', 'PASSUP', 'KEEPER')
    AND p.points = c.amount
)
WHERE c.amount > 0 AND p.id IS NULL
LIMIT 5;

### Financial Reconciliation (Last 7 Days)

```sql
SELECT 
    'Commissions' as source,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) as total_amount
FROM commissions 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND amount > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Points' as source,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    ROUND(SUM(points), 2) as total_amount
FROM points_ledger 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) 
AND source_code IN ('IT', 'PASSUP', 'KEEPER');
```

Commissions	57	2996.54
Points	55	3538.27

### Currency Distribution

```sql
SELECT 
    currency,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(points) as total_points,
    COUNT(DISTINCT memberid) as unique_members
FROM points_ledger 
GROUP BY currency 
ORDER BY total_points DESC;
```

USD	55	3538.27	11

### Source Code Distribution

```sql
SELECT 
    source_code,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(points) as total_points,
    AVG(points) as avg_points
FROM points_ledger 
GROUP BY source_code 
ORDER BY total_points DESC;
```

PASSUP	33	2398.27	72.674848
KEEPER	6	680.00	113.333333
IT	16	460.00	28.750000

## Verification Results

### Data Integrity Checks

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Partial Sync**: 3 commissions still need points records
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Financial Mismatch**: 7-day commission ($2996.54) vs points ($3538.27)

### Sync Quality Metrics

- **Overall Sync Rate:** 94.7%
- **Remaining Missing:** 3 commissions
- **7-Day Commission Total:** $2996.54
- **7-Day Points Total:** $3538.27
- **Financial Match:** ‚ùå FAIL

## Key Achievements

1. **Idempotent Processing:** Unique key prevents duplicate points during re-runs
2. **Currency Assignment:** Automatic USD/INR based on member country  
3. **Source Mapping:** Commission types correctly mapped to points categories
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete transaction history with commission references
5. **Batch Processing:** Efficient handling of large data volumes
6. **Performance Optimized:** Proper indexing for fast queries

## Recommendations

- **Re-run Backfill:** 3 commissions still need processing
  ```bash
  make sync-points BATCH=1003
  ```
- **Investigate Mismatch:** 7-day financial totals don't match - check for:
  - Recent commissions without points integration
  - Manual adjustments in points_ledger
  - Commission deletions or updates

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Sync:** Add `make verify-points` to CI/cron
2. **Real-time Integration:** Ensure all commission creation calls `IMPACT::CommissionHook::post_commission_points()`
3. **Regular Verification:** Weekly reconciliation recommended
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Track sync percentage and response times
